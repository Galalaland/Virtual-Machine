Hello, 

I thought of how little I know about computer hardware, and that it would be too risky for me to experiment on my own computer for the purposes of getting an idea about computer architicture. What if something goes wrong? I can't afford a new one. Then what to do until I get my hands on a computer processor to phsyically play with? emulate one. see it for yourself.
